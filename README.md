# Welcome to My Art Projects Page!

Over the years, I have become more and more invested in the creativity that is art! Art is so freeing, delicately drifting me off to a happy world of comfort when the real world isn't.  I'm sure many others feel the same way and this is one way I ended up with such amazing pieces of art in the palm of my hands at the end! Going on with the show, I will be showcasing some of my most prized art pieces! Let's GO!

## Paper Mache Boat

This boat was one of the first art projects I completed in 3D art and one of my proudest projects so far! The class started out with making a boat shape from cardboard and then putting paper mache on top of it in order to give the boat a more sturdy form. If you don't know what paper mache is, watch this quick [tutorial on paper mache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfmF9D4i8Tg). Next up, we decoarated our boat with some watercolors and even names our boats! I decided to go with a drip style of watercolors; dripping watercolor onto the boat and blowing the water around to create a natural, unpredicatable pattern. I also sprinkled some purple and blue paint onto the floor of my ship, which created a very spotty, yet cool design on that part of the ship. Lastly, we decorated our ships by sewing on sails and little flags on the lines of the boat and gluing a pole in the middle of the ship. 

I thought the boat I created turned out really cool (especially the main colors I picked for my boat haha) and I really enjoyed the process of making it! 

_*Side Note: We were supposed to attach a string on the top, round part of the pole to hang it, but I accidentally broke it when I was transporting it to and from school, so I  decided to attach the string on the sides of the ship XD_


## Mosaic Picture Frame

Next up is the mosaic picture frame, made from gluing various sized pieces of glass onto a wooden picture frame to form an image or a pattern. This is probably the most tedious piece out of them all due to the task of having to find pieces of glass that fit with the other pieces of glass that were already placed onto the frame. Since I went with a rainbow for my frame, finding the correct pieces to transition from one color to the next also took a lot of time. After putting all the glass in place, we grouted it, filling the space in between the glass and I went with a black grout since this made all the colors pop out more. Overall, grouting took less than an hour to finish, but placing the individual pieces of glass probably took over eight to ten hours. 

In the end, the resulting picture frame looked better than any pictuer frame I have ever seen at a regular store! I was extremely happy with the piece and even happier that I was the one that made it! 


## Solar Pillow

This solar pillow is another piece I am extremely proud of! I never thought I would be making my own little pillow for an art project before. First we took a material that changes color when put out under the sun and put on a pattern on the material. Although this process sounds simple, this took quite a bit of time, as the material is expensive and I wanted to make sure this was a perfect as possible. After letting the material soak up some sunlight, we washed the chemicals off and let it dry. For the next part, we decorated the piece with different types of embroidery we learned previously. After finshing up the final few stitches, we sewed on a piece for the back of the pillow and stuffed it with cotton and TADA! A pillow! 

For my piece, I went with a window-like picture with snowflakes outside which took me quite a while to prepare before transferring it onto the pillow. I don't exactly know what the material is called but [this website](https://tinkerlab.com/how-to-make-sun-prints-fabric/) shows something that is similar to what we did. I think making the pattern with that material was definitely the coolest part and the embroidery was also very enjoyable, just time-consuming. Overall, I really love the way my solar pillow turned out and I would love to invest time in a project like this but the piece will be bigger next time! 


## Photography

The past few years, I started to take an interest in photgraphy so I started taking pictures of random things—mostly flowers—and using perspective to make it look cool! These are some of the pictures I thought looked really awesome!

In this picture, these flowers were very tiny when I took them, but by putting the camera really close to the flowers, it made the flowers look huge and full! I'm also pretty sure that these were the only flowers that sprouted out of the entire bush, but you wouldn't be able to tell just from the photo!

Next up are these tiny flowers from a bush in my front yard! The bunches of flowers on the bush definitely looked clustered and messy from afar, but close up, they look absolutely beautiful and full of life! 

<img src="Rainbow.JPG" width=500> 

The last of the three photographs I'm showcasing is this line of rainbow dots I saw in my car. The sunlight reflected off of a gem-like lid on a cup and I was really amazed with the vibrancy of the colors when I initially noticed the spiral of rainbows, so I snapped a quick picture of it to remember in the future!

## Digital Art

Last, but not least, of this showcase of art projects, is my digital art. I used a free drawing program called [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) to help me make these final pieces!

<img src="Helplessness.jpg" width=500> 
<img src="ExternalLocusOfControl.jpg" width=500> 

I drew both of the top two images for an English final. This was actually the first time I used a digital device to draw since I couldn't figure out how to use the drawing application before this. However, after figuring out how the system worked, everything went pretty smoothly! Those two pictures on top were part of a project that talked about the topic of helplessness, which is why there are the words "What is Helplessness" and "External Locus of Control" on the drawing. I'm incredibly proud of the external locus of control (ELC) drawing; I really like the way I drew it and the idea of a human being attached to marionette strings and being controlled by life to showcase what ELC meant. I also really like the second painting because it reminds me of the Spongebob "Imagination" meme!

Lastly, I drew this piece for my beginning art final. This piece took approximately five hours to make and this holds a meaning that is dear to my life. If you know me, you would know that I love sleeping, so in this piece, I drew a person sleeping and the background is the dream that the person is having. I view dreams as an escape from reality; even if your life is awesome, dreams still allow you to try something you can't do in real life!
