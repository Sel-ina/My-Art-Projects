# Welcome to My Art Projects Page!

Over the years, I have become more and more invested in the creativity that is art! Art is so freeing, delicately drifting me off to a happy world of comfort when the real world isn't.  I'm sure many others feel the same way and this is one way I ended up with such amazing pieces of art in the palm of my hands at the end! Going on with the show, I will be showcasing some of my most prized art pieces! Let's gO!
